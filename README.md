# grade-calculator

## Functionality

This calculator features two current formats of grade systems:
- Points in separate weighted categories
- Points within one huge category

(New formats from other grading systems are welcome! Send a pull request or an issue explaining it!)

When the required information regarding these points or categories are entered, the user can then use the entered data to check various score outcomes based on a hypothetical new entry in the class average.

## Requirements

- Beautiful Soup (4)
